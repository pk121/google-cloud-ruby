# Google Cloud Natural Language API Ruby Samples

The [Google Cloud Natural Language API][language_docs] provides natural language
understanding technologies to developers, including sentiment analysis, entity
recognition, and syntax analysis.

## Setup

### Authentication

Authentication is typically done through [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#getting_credentials_for_server-centric_flow)
, which means you do not have to change the code to authenticate as long as your
environment has credentials. You have a few options for setting up
authentication:

1. When running locally, use the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)

    `gcloud auth application-default login`

1. When running on App Engine or Compute Engine, credentials are already set-up.
However, you may need to configure your Compute Engine instance with
[additional scopes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/authentication#using).

1. You can create a [Service Account key file](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#service_accounts)
. This file can be used to authenticate to Google Cloud Platform services from
any environment. To use the file, set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
environment variable to the path to the key file, for example:

    `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account.json`

### Set Project ID

Next, set the *GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT* environment variable to the project name
set in the
[Google Cloud Platform Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com):

    `export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR-PROJECT-ID"`

### Install Dependencies

1. Install the [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) gem.

1. Install dependencies using:

    `bundle install`
